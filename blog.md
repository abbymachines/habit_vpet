So I've had this idea for a self-care app.

Basically it would take all the features of Loop Habits, and add a virtual pet on top of it.

The pet gets hungry/poops on itself the more rings are X's. After a certain amount of days like this, the pet dies and gets replaced.

The pet's hunger meter fills completely only when all the habits are full. Maybe the sensitivity of this feature can be adjusted in the settings

The pet itself can appear as a phone widget, and also gives helpful notifications
